Diffusion Distance for Histogram Comparision


diffusion_distance.py has the code to calculate diffusion distance given two histograms


histogram1.png, histogram2.png, histogram3.png are histograms used for testing


results contains the diffusion distance computed between h1, h2 and h1, h3.


alg.png has the algorithm used for diffusion distance
