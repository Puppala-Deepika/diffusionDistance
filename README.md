Code Contributor : Puppala Deepika (CS14BTECH11027)

Contribution :

diffusion_distance.py has the code to calculate diffusion distance given two histograms

histogram1.png, histogram2.png, histogram3.png are histograms used for testing

results contains the diffusion distance computed between h1, h2 and h1, h3.

alg.png has the algorithm used for diffusion distance
